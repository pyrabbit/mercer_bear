# Mercer Bear Google Assitant Application

This sample application was built as part of a demonstration at the Mercer University's Google Developers group. This application demonstrates how we can use Functions as a Service to scrape calendar events and news about Mercer University. Users can interact with this application by asking their Google assistant about news or events happening on campus.
